<p>My name is Lucas. I like coding and space and cats.</p>

<p>This blog is a stream of conciousness type thing, but the website will also host all my current <a href=/projects/>projects</a>.</p>

<p>Wondering where to start? My <a href=/2014/11/21/hello/>first post</a> is a pretty boring but safe bet.</p>
