It's that time again everyone, exam time! This is truly the time of year when things start to get a *bit* intense for everyone.

[Stress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_%28biology) is something that everyone and everything living shares in common. It's what drives you and keeps you back all at the same time. There isn't a person in the world who isn't stressed about someone or something. 

Look around you next time you're on campus. Everyone else here is going through the same thing you are. Exams are around the corner and 99% of us are floundering and making things up as we go along.

Are you ready for that exam? Are you on track with that paper? No? Neither am I! Neither is the person sitting to your left in class, or your friend that just texted you. 

This time of year is really rough for a lot of people, but you're not alone. You're never alone. Our school has a ton of great services to help you, both in academics and in [other](http://www.queensu.ca/hcds/cs) very useful ways.

If you're struggling badly, reach out for help. If you're not struggling and you see someone who is, see what you can do. Nobody has to do this alone. 

We are all in this together.
