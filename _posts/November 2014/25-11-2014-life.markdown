Have you ever sat down and thought about the way you were a couple years ago?

Today I decided to do that.

<div class="img-center">

</div>

It was kinda horrible. It's weird how much change can happen in only a year or two. I'm not even remotely the same person I was back then, but I think I've mostly grown as a person.

I think back to some of the situations I was in, and how I decided to handle them. I wish I could go back in time and smack some sense into me, but I guess I learned a bunch of lessons along the way to want to change that stuff.

I wonder what two-year-from-now-me will look back on and cringe at? I've made a number of choices recently and I have no idea if I made the right choice for most of them. It's easy to fall into a trap of trying to live in a way that you think two-year-from-now-me will look back on happily. It's not possible to know, because our experiences shape us and guide us. It's important to stay grounded and live for the present you. 

The choices you make today can change your life. My life flipped around a little less than a year ago, and one thing I look back on is really comforting.

I'm doing better now than I was before. Every single day this is true. Each day I am getting stronger and happier and my anxiety is ebbing away.

Sometimes you have to make the hard choices to make sure you can move forward.
