Did you know that [decision problems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem) are some of the most important problems in computer science? 

Recently, I've had to make some pretty tough choices. Lots of time and thought went into it and I finally decided that I would have to put my life on hold for a bit. I'm pushing graduate school by at least a semester so that I can focus on my health instead. 

Much like real life, decision problems come in varying degrees of difficulty. Many of these problems are in NP or harder, meaning that unless [P=NP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem), attacking them will always take a lot of resources.

Choices are sometimes hard, but every one you make is important. Our choices can lead to things that you'd never expect, or they can go exactly as you thought. Each decision is directly contributing to your growth as a person, or lack therof. 

It's okay to have hard decisions to make. It's okay to be afraid and frustrated because it's scary and annoying. Sometimes you will make the wrong choice. Most of the time your choices will lead to neutral situations. 

Once in a while, you will make a choice that was so overwhelmingly correct for your life, it will feel like the world is finally aligning for you.
