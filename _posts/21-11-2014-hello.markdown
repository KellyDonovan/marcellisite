<p> I've never really followed a blog. I certainly never thought I'd actually write one. Lately it seems like it's probably a good idea to put some of my thoughts into a format that I can keep and share. I guess I'm doing this because I want to start having projects in my life again. </p>

<p> The last few years have been crazy and tough and I never found time for me. Now I'm going to do the things that I want to do, and blog about whatever I feel like blogging about. </p>

<p> Join me on a quest to find myself or something. </p>
