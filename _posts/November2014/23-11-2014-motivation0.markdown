We all struggle in our day to day activities. Life throws all sorts of things at you and for a lot of people, just getting out of bed is a mission.

It's a bit comforting in a way, that everybody has *something* to deal with. Some people are mentally ill, others are just having a bad day, but nobody is without worry or stress. You're not alone. You're never alone.

This is a stressful time for students. Exams are around the corner. All your papers are due. Things are piling up and everyone is subsisting on a diet of quick food and coffee. If you begin to feel overwhelmed just look around you while you're on campus. Everyone else is *also* getting ready for exams, and are very likely making it up as they go along. I know I am!

If you're having a bad time, reach out to someone. You'd be surprised on how big of a difference just talking about your problems, even if it's *something silly* like exams or your CISC 124 TA sucks. If you can't find anyone to talk to, or want something a bit more confidential, Queen's has a ton of services, but the one I find myself recommending this time of year the most is [counselling services](http://www.queensu.ca/hcds/cs/). Even if you're not feeling depressed or anxious about anything, talking can still make you feel even better. 

If you see someone struggling and you think you can help, offer it. Giving your time to someone might make a huge difference in their life. 

In school, in work, in life, we can help eachother succeed. 

We are all in this together.
